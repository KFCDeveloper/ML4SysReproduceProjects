%description:
Test that the simulation exits gracefully if there's an error in the startup code.
- exit code must be 1 (not zero and different from crash exit code)
- nothing should be printed after "End" message and the error message (Note "$")

IMPORTANT: This test must be run in isolation, because the startup error would appear
in ALL test cases! See below:

%global:
// UNCOMMENT THE NEXT LINE TO RUN THIS TEST:
//EXECUTE_ON_STARTUP(  throw std::range_error("something bad happened");  );

%activity:
ev << "#UNRESOLVED: test currently disabled, edit it to enable\n";

%exitcode: 1

%contains-regex: stdout
End\.$

%contains-regex: stderr
<!> Error during startup: something bad happened\.$
