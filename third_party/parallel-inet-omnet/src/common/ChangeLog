	* fix in Expression: '-2m' was evaluated to '2' (meter was lost)

2012-01-14  Andras Varga

	* MatchExpression: OR operator made optional.
	E.g. now "Host" or "Router" or "Switch" can be written as "Host Router Switch",
	which is more natural at places (code that so far took a space-separated
	list of possible items, like node selectors in INET's configurator,
	can now be naturally extended to have more power by using
	MatchExpression, without affecting existing users or making OR mandatory).
