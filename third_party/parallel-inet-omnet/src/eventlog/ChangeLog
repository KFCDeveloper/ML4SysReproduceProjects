	* library renamed to oppeventlog

2008-02-23  Andras Varga

	* Started the ChangeLog. The Eventlog library was added in omnetpp-4.0.
	It implements reading and traversing eventlog files recorded by
	simulations, and also provides a command-line tool (eventlogtool).
	Files >2GB are supported. The lib is used by Sequence Charts
	in the IDE. Author: Levente Meszaros.
